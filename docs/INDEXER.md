# Indexer

The indexer polls the Stellar RPC for contract events emitted by the two
StreamGive smart contracts and writes the results into the PostgreSQL database.
It runs as a background loop inside the same Node.js process as the API server
(see [`src/indexer/worker.ts`](../src/indexer/worker.ts)).

## Watched contracts

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NGO_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` | Tracks NGO registrations and admin approvals |
| `DONATION_VAULT_CONTRACT_ID` | Tracks streaming donation lifecycle (create / withdraw / cancel) |

Both ids are optional. The indexer no-ops until at least one is set.

## Event table

Each row shows one on-chain event topic, whether the indexer handles it, and
which database rows it creates or updates when it does.

### ngo-registry contract

| Topic | Handled | DB writes |
|---|---|---|
| `register` | Yes | Upserts `ngos` row (`ownerAddress`, `name`, `verified = false`). Updates `name` if the row already exists. |
| `approved` | Yes | Sets `verified = true` on the matching `ngos` row via `updateMany` (no-ops if the row does not exist yet — safe for a mid-history start). |

Handler: [`src/indexer/handlers/ngoRegistry.ts`](../src/indexer/handlers/ngoRegistry.ts)

### donation-vault contract

| Topic | Handled | DB writes |
|---|---|---|
| `created` | Yes | Upserts `donors` and `ngos` rows for the involved addresses (creating placeholders if unseen), then upserts a `streams` row with `status = ACTIVE`, initial `balance`, and `withdrawn = 0`. Emits a `stream_created` webhook notification. |
| `withdraw` | Yes | Subtracts the accrued amount from `streams.balance` and adds it to `streams.withdrawn`. No-ops if the stream row does not exist. Emits a `stream_withdrawn` notification. |
| `cancel` | Yes | Adds the settled amount to `streams.withdrawn`, zeroes `balance` and `rate`, sets `status = CANCELLED`. No-ops if the stream row does not exist. Emits a `stream_cancelled` notification. |
| `topup` | No | The event only publishes the new deposit amount, not how much accrued and settled to the NGO during the same call, so the post-topup balance cannot be reconstructed from the payload alone without either a contract read or duplicating the accrual math. Tracked as a follow-up. |
| `ratemod` | No | Same reason as `topup` — the new rate is known but the accrual that settled at the moment of the rate change is not. Tracked as a follow-up. |

Handler: [`src/indexer/handlers/donationVault.ts`](../src/indexer/handlers/donationVault.ts)

## Checkpoint

The indexer stores the last ledger it successfully processed in the
`indexer_checkpoints` table (a single row with `id = 'main'`).  On startup it
reads this row and resumes from `lastLedger + 1`, so a restart never
re-processes already-seen events.

**First run** — if no checkpoint row exists the indexer writes the current
ledger as the starting point and returns without fetching events. The next poll
picks up from there, so only events emitted *after* the first startup are
indexed; the contract's full history is not back-filled.

**Per-event checkpointing** — the checkpoint is saved after each individual
event, not once per batch. Several handlers apply relative deltas
(`balance -= accrued`, etc.), so replaying an already-applied event after a
crash would double-count it. Saving after each event bounds the damage to "at
most the in-flight event" on a crash.

### Out-of-window behaviour

The Stellar RPC only retains a sliding window of recent ledgers (typically the
last ~17,280 ledgers / ~24 hours on Mainnet). It rejects a `getEvents` call
whose `startLedger` falls outside that window with a JSON-RPC `-32600` error.

Two ways the checkpoint can fall outside the window:

| Scenario | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Ahead of the tip** | The indexer checkpoints at the latest ledger, so the very next poll asks for `latest + 1`, which has not closed yet. The poll returns immediately and waits for the next interval — no action needed. |
| **Behind the retention window** | If the process is down for longer than the RPC's retention period, the saved checkpoint ages out. The indexer detects the `-32600` error, logs a warning that events in the gap were missed, skips the checkpoint forward to the current ledger, and resumes. This keeps the indexer running rather than looping on a permanent error, at the cost of a gap in the indexed history. |

The skip-forward warning is intentionally loud:

```
indexer: checkpoint <N> has aged out of the RPC's retention window —
skipping to ledger <M>. Events in between were missed and will not be indexed.
```

If you need complete history after an outage longer than the retention window,
replay the missed ledger range from an archive node (not currently automated).
